          In a life that gotten oh so dark, oh so dark
          A life that falls apart, falls apart
          My heart been torn apart (torn apart)
          I've been torn apart
          I'm a fucking loner and I stay that way for life
          I probably never change even though I'd like to
          Even though I'd like to
          I probably never change for nothing, my dear
          All my insecurities holding me near
          I probably never change for nothing, my dear
          All my insecurities holding me near
          Mmm, but I been working oh so hard
          To find some meaning in this life, yeah
          To find some meaning in this life
          In a life that gotten oh so dark, oh so dark
          A life that falls apart, falls apart
          My heart been torn apart, torn apart
          I been bleeding on the inside, I'm torn apart
          Can I get a chance to go back to the start?
          Ayy, yeah, press rewind
          Get a chance to find
          The right answers
          I mean I don't wanna die
          I just wanna feel alive
          Maybe in my next life get a chance to feel alive
          But people say you only get one chance
          So I gotta work hard, ayy, yeah, ayy
          To try and fight a light
          Yeah, find a light
          In a life that gotten oh so dark, oh so dark
          A life that falls apart, falls apart
          My heart been torn apart, torn apart
          I been bleeding on the inside, I'm torn apart
          Can I get a chance to go back to the start?
          Ayy, yeah, press rewind
          Get a chance to find
          I hope somewhere down the line
          I'll be able to find the light
          The light, the light
          In a life that gotten oh so dark, oh so dark
          A life that falls apart, falls apart
          My heart been torn apart, torn apart
          I been bleeding on the inside, I'm torn apart
          Can I get a chance to go back to the start?
          Ayy, yeah, press rewind.
